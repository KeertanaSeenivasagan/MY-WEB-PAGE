          <b><h3 class="c">The Cupping Rituals</h3></b>
          <p class="b">Within these revered cupping rooms, a small group of just 15 individuals possess the expertise to make vital determinations regarding the quality and flavor characteristics of our coffee. With a shared vocabulary of descriptors and tasting notes, these coffee connoisseurs meticulously calibrate their palates. Depending on the season, they may delight in anywhere from 100 to 600 cups of coffee each day, accumulating an astounding total of 250,000 cups annually. This extraordinary feat stands as a testament to their unwavering dedication and profound passion for their craft.</p>
          <b><h3 class="c">Unveiling the Process</h3></b>
          <p class="b">The journey of coffee sampling is a meticulous process. Green beans are first visually inspected for overall quality, then carefully roasted, ground, and infused in boiling water. The tester's olfactory senses are tantalized as they breathe in the aromatic brew. After allowing the coffee to settle, the tester breaks the crust by gently pushing aside the grounds, inhaling the renewed aroma. And thus, the tasting begins.</p>
